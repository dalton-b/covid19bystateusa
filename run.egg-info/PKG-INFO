Description: # COVID19 by state
        The project website is available here:
        
        https://covid19bystateusa.com
        
        This project displays the number of COVID19 cases and deaths in each US state and territory, as well as each country. Cases are displayed as a running total, with cases 28 days old or older removed from the total. This essentially gives us an estimate of the number of people who are currently sick with COVID19 in a given state, territory, or country.
